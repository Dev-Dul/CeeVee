# CeeVee

This is my first full-length react project, as part of The Odin Project React Curriculum. CeeVee is a CV Application Builder that uses a multi-step form approach to collect relevant data from the user and build the final CV application.

## Features

Asides from building the user's CV, CeeVee has the following features:

* CV Preview: CeeVee shows the user an image preview of the final CV application before it is downloaded so the user can check for any errors or typos.

* Modification: In the preview stage, should the any typos or errors be found, CeeVee allows the user to correct them by using the edit button.

* Pdf Download: The Final CV is downloaded to the user's device by clicking the download button.
